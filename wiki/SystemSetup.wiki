#summary Basic ROS System Installation

= Introduction =

We use ROS fuerte on a Ubuntu 12.04 machine. To be able to make the most of the workshop you should set it up like described. You can also use a virtual machine, but this might not work well with some of the ROS visualization tools.

== ROS Setup ==

 * We need to install ROS. Very detailed instructions for that are available [http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu here]
 * After installation, open a new terminal and try to use a ROS command:
{{{
roscd
}}}
 If this complains about "ROS_WORKSPACE", the installation worked.
