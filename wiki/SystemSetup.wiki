#summary Basic ROS System Installation

= Introduction =

We use ROS fuerte on a Ubuntu 12.04 machine. To be able to make the most of the workshop you should set it up like described. You can also use a virtual machine, but this might not work well with some of the ROS visualization tools.

= Details =

== ROS Setup ==

 * ROS needs to be installed. Very detailed instructions for that are available [http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu here]
 * After installation, open a new terminal and try to use a ROS command:
{{{
roscd
}}}
 If this complains about "ROS_WORKSPACE", the installation worked.


== Repository Setup ==

 * To use some existing software, we need to check out software from different repositories. These are:
  * [http://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/fuerte/trunk/ tu darmstadt ros pkg] (svn)
  * The repository belonging to this workshop [http://irrw2012.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ irrw2012] (svn)
 * We use a quick manual setup of repositories (a rosinstall based method could also be used)
  * Enter your '/opt' directory and create a new 'repositories' directory:
{{{
cd /opt
sudo mkdir repositories
}}}
  * Change the user rights so you have full access:
{{{
sudo chown $USER repositories
}}}
