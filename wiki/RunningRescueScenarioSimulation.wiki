#summary Running a complete Rescue scenario in simulation

= Introduction =

This tutorial shows how to demonstrate a simulated Hector Lightweight UGV (HLUGV) in gazebo, including SLAM, mapping of objects of interest as well as optionally autonomous exploration.


= Details =
* Open a terminal, start a roscore
{{{
roscore
}}}
* Start a gazebo simulation scenario, for example
{{{
roslaunch hector_nist_arena_worlds thailand_robot_championship_2012_flat.launch
}}}
* Spawn the simulated HLUGV into the scenario:
{{{
roslaunch hlugv_gazebo spawn_hlugv_cam_lidar.launch
}}}
* Start the mapping, geotiff writing and object tracker using 
{{{
roslaunch hlugv_apps hlugv_worldmodel_all.launch
}}}
