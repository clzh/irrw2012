#summary Running a complete Rescue scenario in simulation

= Introduction =

This tutorial shows how to demonstrate a simulated Hector Lightweight UGV (HLUGV) in gazebo, including SLAM, mapping of objects of interest as well as optionally autonomous exploration.


= Details =
 * Build the hlugv_apps package, this should result in all dependencies getting built:
{{{
rosmake hlugv_apps
}}}
 * Open a terminal, start a roscore
{{{
roscore
}}}
 * Start a gazebo simulation scenario, for example
{{{
roslaunch hector_nist_arena_worlds thailand_robot_championship_2012_flat.launch
}}}
 * Spawn the simulated HLUGV into the scenario:
{{{
roslaunch hlugv_gazebo spawn_hlugv_cam_lidar.launch
}}}
 * Start the mapping, geotiff writing and object tracker using 
{{{
roslaunch hlugv_apps hlugv_worldmodel_all.launch
}}}
 * There are now options on how to proceed: 
  * You can now manually control the robot by using some method of publishing a [http://www.ros.org/doc/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html geometry_msgs/Twist] message on the 'cmd_vel' topic.
  * You can start autonomous exploration using
{{{
 roslaunch hlugv_apps hector_simple_exploration.launch
}}}
